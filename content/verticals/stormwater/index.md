## Overview
Stormwater runoff often carries oils, heavy metals, sediments, and excess nutrients into rivers and lakes.  
Biochar filtration media offers a low-cost, sustainable way to polish stormwater before it enters natural waterways.  
This DIY pathway shows how a simple biochar filter can be assembled for downspouts, retention ponds, or small outfalls.  

---

## How It Works

1. **Collect runoff** in a settling basin or sump before it discharges.

2. **Filter through a biochar media bed** (often mixed with sand or compost).

3. **Discharge cleaner water** to a pond, wetland, or storm drain.

## Bill of Materials
- 55-gallon plastic drum or concrete box (acts as filter housing)  
- PVC piping and valves  
- Layers: gravel (coarse), sand (fine), biochar (activated if possible)  
- Geotextile fabric to separate media layers  
- Basic tools: drill, saw, shovel  

---

## Build Steps

1. Cut inlet/outlet holes in the drum at appropriate heights.  
2. Add gravel layer for drainage.  
3. Add sand layer to catch fines.  
4. Add 20–30 cm of biochar media.  
5. Cover with geotextile and secure lid.  
6. Connect inlet pipe from catch basin and outlet pipe to discharge point.

## Performance & QA
- **Metals capture:** Zn, Cu, Pb often reduced >50%.  
- **Nutrient capture:** P reduced 20–60% if iron-treated biochar is used.  
- **Flow rate:** Check for clogging; backflush or replace media annually.  
- **QA tests:** Collect influent/effluent samples and send for lab analysis.
