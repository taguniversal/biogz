## Overview
Biogas reclamation is the process of capturing methane and carbon dioxide from decomposing organic waste (landfills, food waste, or manure) and turning it into a usable source of renewable energy. 

By integrating **biochar** into the system, we can:
- Improve gas quality (removing H₂S and other contaminants)
- Reduce odors
- Stabilize nutrient-rich digestate for use as fertilizer

---

## How It Works

1. **Collect** organic waste in an anaerobic environment (no oxygen).

2. **Capture** the gas produced (mostly methane and CO₂).

3. **Filter** the gas with biochar to remove contaminants like hydrogen sulfide.

4. **Use** the biogas in a combined heat and power (CHP) engine, boiler, or inject into the gas grid.

5. **Apply** treated digestate to soil as a stabilized organic fertilizer.

## Bill of Materials (DIY Starter)
- Sealed anaerobic digester tank (plastic or concrete)
- Gas-tight piping and valves
- Simple gas storage bladder or tank
- Biochar filter (packed column, 1–2 meters)
- Gas burner or small CHP unit
- PPE (gloves, respirator for H₂S)

## ROI
DIY systems can reduce waste hauling costs, generate heat/electricity, and produce usable fertilizer.  
Commercial systems scale this up for municipalities and waste companies.
