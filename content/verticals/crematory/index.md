## Overview
Alkaline hydrolysis (aqua-cremation) produces an effluent that is sterile but highly alkaline (pH ~11–12).  
By carefully buffering and dosing this effluent onto high-surface-area biochar, it can be converted into a **nutrient-charged carbon-negative fertilizer**.  

This process closes the loop between mortuary practices and agriculture, while sequestering carbon and reducing waste.

## How It Works

1. **Characterize effluent**: measure pH, alkalinity, and nutrient content (N, P, Ca, trace metals).

<!-- Prompt: 'Illustration of a laboratory bench with a pH meter, test tubes, and labeled nutrient charts, showing analysis of crematory effluent.' -->
2. **Buffer to target pH (6.5–7.5)** with CO₂ sparging or acid dosing (carbonic acid or phosphoric acid).

3. **Dose onto high-SA biochar** (600–900 °C pyrolysis), at 0.5–1.5 L/kg depending on nutrient analysis.

   <!--Prompt: 'Cross-section of a ribbon blender with biochar inside, effluent being sprayed evenly over it with nozzles, arrows showing mixing motion.'   -->

4. **Cure for 24–72h** to stabilize nutrient binding, then **granulate** for even field application.

## Bill of Materials
- pH meter (±0.01 precision)  
- Dosing pump  
- Food-grade CO₂ cylinder and sparger  
- Buffer tank (HDPE)  
- PPE (gloves, face shield, goggles)  
- High-surface-area biochar (≥700 m²/g)  
- Granulator or binder (molasses, lignin)

## Build Steps

1. Prepare a neutralization tank with agitation.  
2. Slowly titrate effluent down to pH 7.0 ± 0.3.  
3. Transfer neutralized liquid into dosing system.  
4. Spray evenly over biochar in a ribbon blender, reaching 30–45% moisture.  
5. Cure for 1–3 days in covered trays.  
6. Granulate and screen pellets to 1–4 mm.

## Performance & QA
- **Chemical checks:** pH 6.5–7.5, nutrient loading within design range.  
- **Lab tests:** run TCLP/metals checks to confirm environmental safety.  
- **Pathogen assurance:** effluent is sterile post-hydrolysis, but curing provides extra margin.
